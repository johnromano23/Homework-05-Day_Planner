## User Story
This is a simple application that uses basic front-end development. It functions as a daily scheduler that users can use from 8 am until 5 pm. This application uses Moment.js to show users the current date and time. Users can write notes, reminders or anything they want to in the time blocks and save it using local storage. 

## Technology Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Moment.js
* Local Storage

## Usage
Access the application by clicking on the application link. To test the application, simply write something in any of the time blocks and click the corresponding save button next  to it. Reload the page and the saved item should still be on the time block. 

## Future Development
* Include a clear button function to clear out items
* Design the application more dynamically/ add colors
